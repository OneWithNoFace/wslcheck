Check whether you are running Linux in WSL or not

## TODO List

- [ ] Check whether linux is running on WSL 2 or not
- [ ] Added support for WSL 1
- [ ] Return WSL version
- [ ] Return the version and name of the linux kernel
- [ ] Return the OS name and version 

## Motivation

I was trying to contribute to an open source project and realised that I needed to check whether the linux was running in WSL (Windows Subsytem for Linux) or not.

## Project
This is my first open source project. There would be many things that might not be upto the standards in the project. Contributions/Suggestions/Help would be highly appreciated.

I am also looking for someone who can guide in this endeavour. Thanks :thumbsup:
